## Goal Description
Improve site loading speed by implementing server-side caching for BMLT API requests (reducing external network calls) and verifying asset optimizations.

## Proposed Changes

### Server Cache

#### [MODIFY] [src/server/bmlt.ts](file:///Users/louisc/my-progs/websites/port-city-na-org/src/server/bmlt.ts)
- Implement a simple in-memory cache with TTL (Time To Live).
- **`fetchJsonCached(url, ttl)`**: Wrapper around `fetchJson`.
- Cache Duration:
    - Meetings: 5-15 minutes (Data doesn't change instantly).
    - Server Info/Service Bodies: 1 hour.

### Assets

#### [CHECK] [public/charleston-bridge-hero-image.jpeg]
- Verify file size. If huge (>500KB), recommend resizing or converting to WebP. (Since I can't resize binaries easily, I will just report if it's too big, or use `sharp` if configured, but better to just use a smaller image if available).
- For now, the primary win is caching the API.

## Verification Plan

### Manual Verification
1.  **API Speed**: Load page -> slow (first miss). Reload -> fast (cache hit).
2.  **Logs**: Add console logs to `bmlt.ts` to show "CACHE HIT" vs "CACHE MISS".
