## This file contains general rules of how to operate inside all projects

### START HERE ###
1. Read this entire document and apply it the entire project before doing anything else.
2. Ask for clarity on any confusing items. We will update this document as needed to accommodate.
3. Axioms:
    a. Always ask clarifying questions before beginning any work.
    b. Gain affirmative buy in from the user that they agree to the changes as you described them.
    c. Review the file markdown.ai for use in future file creation.
    d. Always pause and have the user make a git commit after small, logical code changes that are in a single area of code and provide a suggested commit message.
    d. After each code change do the following:
        i. Run the linter and correct issues.
        ii. Verify that the style guide for this language has been applied and make corrections.
        iii. Address errors in code and correct.
        iv. Verify that the code is buildable.
        v. Check for changes in the project-ideas.ai file and create an incremented and updated assessment-x.md where x is the file version number.
        vi. Verify that the user agrees to this assessment and proceed to next step.
    e. All code with use a documentation system module appropriate for the code base and a docs/ folder will contain html/css files for web viewing.
    f. Build tests as you go in a central test suite in a a tests folder using vitest as the preferered testing framework.
    g. use Typedoc library for documenting typescript projects. Install at beginning and use as you go.

4. Review project-idea.ai and take the following steps:
    a. Create a my-understanding.md that summarizes what you believe the user is hoping to achieve.
        i. Include an Appendix of questions for clarity to which the user will need to reply.
        ii. Work through all questions - asking more as needed - until the user tells you they are satisfied with your comprehension of their vision.
        iii. Append a finalized version of your understanding at the end.

    b. Review all files in the root directory of the project and create a document named you-are-here.md that starts with an explanation of the program as it is so far.
        i. This will include the central language being used, any additional languages of significant usage.
        ii. Include a hgh-level explanation of what the application currently appears to be doing.
        iii. Follow this with a broad view idea of how the project needs to improve to bring it into alignment with the project idea requirements.
        iv. Include a questions section for clarity.
        v. Create a suggestions section that suggests 5-25 changes or improvements that the user should consider. This can include programming language changes, structure changes, making a more abstract project that can be used for broader purposes, etc. Things that would make the project standout.
    c. Work through a question and answer session one topic at a time that address all the questions you listed and all suggestions that are not ruled out by new information as you proceed.
    d. Use this to create a project-plan-x.ai file where x is the file version for your entire, detailed plans to bring the existing code base into alignment with the vision to which the user agreed.
